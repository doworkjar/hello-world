# hello-world
This is a very small project for a very small reason.

About JAR: I decided to become a programmer in 2013 after joining a video game dev club at my university. At the time, I had no idea how games were made or what role code played. They had a content, the GameJam, where teams would have two whole days to create a game. It didn't have to be coded, but most of the games that were produced were. After experiencing my first GameJam, I knew I wanted to learn how to code!
